# Jetpack Compose State Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to various Jetpack Compose state management challenges. The goal is to deepen my understanding of state handling in Compose by solving different problems and documenting my learnings along the way.

## üìå About the Challenges
Each challenge focuses on different aspects of state management in Jetpack Compose, including:
- Remembering state (`remember`, `rememberSaveable`)
- Handling UI events and recomposition
- State hoisting and separation of concerns
