# Jetpack Compose State Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to various Jetpack Compose state management challenges. The goal is to deepen my understanding of state handling in Compose by solving different problems and documenting my learnings along the way.

## 📌 About the Challenges
Each challenge focuses on different aspects of state management in Jetpack Compose, including:
- Remembering state (`remember`, `rememberSaveable`)
- Handling UI events and recomposition
- State hoisting and separation of concerns
- Using `MutableState` and `StateFlow`
- Working with `ViewModel` for state management

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/compose-state-challenges.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **Android Studio** (latest stable version recommended).
3. Build and run the application on an emulator or a physical device.
